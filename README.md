# LAP 3 Thursday REDUX

- `mkdir redux-thursday && cd $_ && npx create-react-app .`
- Redux library
- npm install react-router

- make navbar 
- add balance : 0 
- when balance in deposit is + 100 we want to add it to the homepage

## GOAL: Share states between components:

- REDUX state manager (easier to debug)
- npm install redux react-redux
- useSelector to read state (redux)
- connect state 
- store is where the state lives 
- action is object that takes type as field
